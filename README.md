# shortest path visualization


It's a BFS implementation where the shortest path between two points is displayed. 

There are four types of cells, the start, the end, blocked cells and cells where the path can go. You can change them all through
the GUI. 

### Things to implement

* Improve the bind, now it's not very accurate.
* Make graphics more aesthetic
* Display the information on the Text widget
* clear all button to remove all walls
* Create more mazes
* Implement more algs like largest path or forcing to go through a specific cell
